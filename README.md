# ArkDeployToolkit
A streamlined solution for creating bootable USB drives that lets you deploy Windows images directly to a PCâ€”without relying on the Microsoft setup application. The toolkit also allows for image capture for backup and mass deployment scenarios. Windows images can be stored locally on the USB drive or accessed over a network via SMB shares.
